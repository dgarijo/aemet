# AEMET to Linked Data: Resources for the RDF conversion 

This repository contains the scripts, data samples and converted data samples for transforming the AEMET weather data into RDF.

Disclaimer: These samples were obtained in 2011. The API may have changed since then. We encourage anyone to study the new API: https://opendata.aemet.es/centrodedescargas/inicio

The rdfization of AEMET is a collaboration between (in alphabetical order) Ghislain Atemezing, Oscar Corcho, Daniel Garijo, José Mora, María Poveda-Villalón, Pablo Rozas, Daniel Vila-Suero and Boris Villazón-Terrazas. You can find more details in the paper: "Transforming Meteorological Data into Linked Data": http://www.semantic-web-journal.net/sites/default/files/swj281_0.pdf
